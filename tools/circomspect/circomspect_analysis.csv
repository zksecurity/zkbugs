"Statistics of the Bugs:

- **Total Vulnerabilities Analyzed**: 25
- **Unconstrained Assignments**: 12
  - Successfully Detected: 7
  - Missed: 5
- **Missing Range/Bit Length Checks**: 5
  - Successfully Detected: 0
  - Missed: 5
- **Division by Zero**: 6
  - Successfully Detected: 6
  - Missed: 0
- **Circomspect did not find the bug but it is expected in that scenario**: 4
- **In total, Circomspect achieved (7 + 6) / (25 - 4) = 61.9% success rate in the current dataset.**

Overall, Circomspect demonstrated effectiveness in identifying unconstrained assignments and division by zero vulnerabilities but struggled with detecting missing range checks and logical bugs. The manual fixes have addressed these issues, ensuring the circuits are now secure and properly constrained.

## Evaluation of Circomspect's Performance

### 1. circom/circomlib_mimc/kobi_gurkan_mimc_hash_assigned_but_not_constrained",No,"Circomspect says ""Using the signal assignment operator `<--` is not necessary here"" but does not find the actual bug."
2. circom/reclaimprotocol_circom_chacha/zksecurity_unsound_left_rotation,Yes,"Circomspect accurately detected the unconstrained signals, matching the described vulnerability."
3. circom/spartan_ecdsa/yacademy_input_signal_s_is_not_constrained_in_eff_ecdsa_circom,No,Circomspect failed to identify the main vulnerability related to the unconstrained `s`.
4. circom/spartan_ecdsa/yacademy_under_constrained_circuits_compromising_the_soundness_of_the_system,Yes,Circomspect successfully detected the unconstrained signals.
5. circom/darkforest_circuits/daira_hopwood_darkforest_v0_3_missing_bit_length_check,No,Circomspect failed to identify the missing bit length check.
6. circom/semaphore-protocol_semaphore/veridise_no_zero_value_validation,No,"Circomspect found something interesting, although that's not a bug. That code is just there to prevent [groth16 malleability attack](https://geometry.xyz/notebook/groth16-malleability). `signalHash` is an unused public input, it has to be there for some business logic reason outside the circuit. The constraint `signalHashSquared <== signalHash * signalHash` is added to prevent the attack described in the article."
7. circom/succinctlabs_telepathy-circuits/veridise_arrayxor_is_under_constrained,Yes,"Correct, Circomspect successfully detected the unconstrained signal."
8. circom/circom-bigint_circomlib/veridise_underconstrained_outputs_in_window4,"No, but expected",This is expected since the bug is in external templates. The target circuit itself has no bug.
9. circom/succinctlabs_telepathy-circuits/trailofbits_prover_can_lock_user_funds_by_supplying_non-reduced_Y_values_to_G1BigIntToSignFlag,No,Circomspect did not directly address the missing range check for y-coordinate.
10. circom/succinctlabs_telepathy-circuits/trailofbits_incorrect_handling_of_point_doubling_can_allow_signature_forgery,"No, but expected",This is expected since it is a logical bug.
11. circom/uniRep_protocol/veridise_missing_range_checks_on_comparison_circuits,No,Circomspect had trouble parsing the circuit code.
12. circom/uniRep_protocol/veridise_underconstrained_circuit_allows_invalid_comparison,Yes,"In particular, Circomspect found ""Using `Num2Bits` to convert field elements to bits may lead to aliasing issues"" which is the same as the actual bug."
13. circom/zkopru/leastauthority_previously_correct_ownership_proof_disabled_via_code_changes,No,"Circomspect did not find the issue. This bug is about misuse of external template, which isn't programmed into circomspect analysis rules."
14. circom/circom-bigint_circomlib/veridise_underconstrained_points_in_montgomeryAdd,Yes,"Circomspect successfully detected the unconstrained division, it was the ""In signal assignments containing division, the divisor needs to be constrained to be non-zero"" finding."
15. circom/circom-bigint_circomlib/veridise_missing_range_checks_in_bigmod,No,"Circomspect outputs a bunch of warning but none of them is the actual bug. Also, lots of false positive means bad performance."
16. circom/circom-bigint_circomlib/veridise_decoder_accepting_bogus_output_signal,No,This is expected since it is a logical bug.
17.  circom/circom-bigint_circomlib/veridise_underconstrained_points_in_edwards2Montgomery,Yes,"Circomspect successfully detected the unconstrained division, specifically it was ""In signal assignments containing division, the divisor needs to be constrained to be non-zero""."
18. circom/circom-bigint_circomlib/veridise_underconstrained_points_in_montgomeryDouble,Yes,"Circomspect successfully detected the unconstrained division, specifically it was ""In signal assignments containing division, the divisor needs to be constrained to be non-zero""."
19. circom/circom-bigint_circomlib/veridise_underconstrained_points_in_montgomery2Edwards,Yes,"Circomspect successfully detected the unconstrained division, specifically it was ""In signal assignments containing division, the divisor needs to be constrained to be non-zero""."
20. circom/maci/hashcloak_data_are_not_fully_verified_during_state_update,No,Circomspect did not find the bug.
21. circom/circom-bigint_circomlib/veridise_underconstrained_outputs_in_bitElementMulAny,Yes,"Circomspect successfully detected the unconstrained division, specifically it was ""In signal assignments containing division, the divisor needs to be constrained to be non-zero""."
23. circom/circom-bigint_circomlib/veridise_underconstrained_outputs_in_windowmulfix,"No, but expected","This is expected since the bug is in external templates, not the target circuit code."
24. circom/circom-bigint_circomlib/veridise_decoder_accepting_bogus_output_signal,Yes,"Circomspect successfully detected the unconstrained division, specifically it was ""In signal assignments containing division, the divisor needs to be constrained to be non-zero""."
