test test_3reg_instruction_coverage ... 
=== 3-Register Instructions Coverage ===
All RV32IM 3-register instructions affected:
  Integer: ADD, SUB, SLL, SLT, SLTU, XOR, SRL, SRA, OR, AND
  Multiply: MUL, MULH, MULHSU, MULHU
  Divide: DIV, DIVU, REM, REMU

All instructions must handle rs1 == rs2 case correctly

test test_differential_pattern_analysis ... 
=== Differential Pattern Analysis ===

Expected patterns in VULNERABLE commit (9838780):
  - No load_rs2 function
  - Direct ctx.load_register(decoded.rs2) calls
  - SAFE_WRITE_ADDR without increment
  - No ensure!(txn.cycle != txn.prev_cycle)
  - No is_same_reg field in layout

Expected patterns in FIXED commit (67f2d81):
  - load_rs2 function defined
  - load_rs2 checks if rs1 == rs2
  - load_rs2 used in step_compute and step_mem_ops
  - SAFE_WRITE_ADDR + j pattern
  - ensure!(txn.cycle != txn.prev_cycle)
  - is_same_reg field in zirgen layout

test test_register_file_constraints ... 
=== Architecture Invariants ===
Register File Constraints:
  - 32 general-purpose registers (x0-x31)
  - x0 always reads as 0
  - x0 writes are ignored
  - Single read per register per cycle (when rs1 == rs2)
  - No same-cycle conflicts for same address
