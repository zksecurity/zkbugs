## Short Description of the Vulnerability

The ChaCha20 interface in the library can be easily misused because it allows users to provide their own key, nonce, starting counter, and plaintext/ciphertext inputs without any built-in constraints on these inputs. Typically, nonces are initialized in a standard manner, making it potentially safer to exclude user input for this component. The current design assumes all inputs are 32-bit, but does not enforce this, which increases the risk of misuse. Suggestions include renaming the interface to indicate its unchecked nature and adding documentation highlighting the importance of input constraints, or alternatively, designing an interface that enforces these constraints automatically.

## Short Description of the Exploit



## Proposed Mitigation

To address the 'Potentially Easy-to-Misuse Interface' issue in the ChaCha20 circuit, the recommended fix includes adding warnings in the documentation about the necessity to constrain inputs as 32-bit values and considering renaming the interface to `ChaCha20Unsafe` or `ChaCha20Unchecked` to alert users about the need for careful handling. Additionally, an alternative interface should be provided that enforces checks on all inputs.
