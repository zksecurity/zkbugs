    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The \"Unsound XOR gadget\" bug found in the \"generics.circom\" of the Reclaim Protocol's ChaCha20 circuit relates to the incorrect implementation of the XOR operation on two M-bit value arrays. The bit constraints meant to ensure that the set bits were either 0 or 1 were commented out during the audit, compromising the security and validity of the operation. The XOR logic was supposed to decompose each operand into a series of checks on individual bits, but it failed to enforce that all bits must exactly represent the original values, allowing a malicious party to exploit the poorly constrained bit representation.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "The recommended fix for the 'Unsound XOR gadget' is to enforce an XOR constraint (res = a + b - 2*ab) on each bit individually, ensuring that each bit is correctly constrained as 0 or 1."
