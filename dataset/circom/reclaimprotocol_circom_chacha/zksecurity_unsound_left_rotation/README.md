## Short Description of the Vulnerability

The `part1` and `part2` signals are not sufficiently constrained. One can arbitrarily set a value to `part1` or `part2` and find a value for the other signal to satisfy the constraint on line 45. This way you can get another `out` value for a given `in`.

## Short Description of the Exploit

To exploit the vulnerability, one has to simply find a witness that produces a different value for `out` rather than the one produced by the witness generator. The sage script demonstrates how to find another witness that satisfies the constraints. Then, you simply need to produce a new proof.

## Proposed Mitigation

The recommendation to fix this issue was to constrain `part1` (resp. `part2`) to be (resp. ) bit-sized values. For the concrete mitigation applied, check the commit of the fix.
