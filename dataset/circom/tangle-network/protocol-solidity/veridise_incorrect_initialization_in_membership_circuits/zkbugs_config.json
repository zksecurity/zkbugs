    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The templates `SetMembership` try to check if an element e is in a set S by generating a constraint of the form: for all  s in S, product of (s - e) = 0. They do does this by iterating over elements s of the set S and building the product. The issue is that `product[0]` is initialized to `element` which makes the constarint to be trivailly satisfied when `element` is 0.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "The template `SetMembership` is used to check whether a computed Merkle root belongs to a set of known Merkle roots. A malicious user that knows how to compute a Merkle root equal to 0 could pass along the hashes and generate an invalid proof.",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "We recommend that `product[0]` is initialized to 1."
