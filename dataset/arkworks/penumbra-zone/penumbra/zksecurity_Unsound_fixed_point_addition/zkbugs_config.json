    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug 'Unsound fixed-point addition' involves a fault in the fixed-point arithmetic used in Penumbra's logic. The `checked_add` function in `U128x128Var`, a 256-bit type, underconstrains some operations, potentially leading to incorrect results. This function converts limbs to field values and adds them, tracking carry for each limb and ensuring no overflow. However, the carry bit, resulting from adding two 64-bit values that produce a 65-bit result, is not properly managed. This improper handling could erroneously set all carry bits (`c1`) to zero during proving, leading to unsound additions in certain scenarios.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "To fix the issue of unsound fixed-point addition in Penumbra's circuits, Penumbra released a fix that correctly computes each limb in the circuit."
