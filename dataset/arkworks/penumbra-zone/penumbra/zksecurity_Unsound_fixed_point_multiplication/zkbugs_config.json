    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The 'Unsound fixed-point multiplication' bug occurs when scaling two fixed-point values in the multiplication operation, leading to improper computation of the result due to incorrect limb handling. This error is critical as it impacts the accuracy of fixed-point arithmetic operations in the system, specifically in the context of financial calculations where precision is paramount. The issue lies in incorrectly accounting for overflow and implementing the truncation step required to maintain precision, essentially failing to scale back the multiplied result properly.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "Penumbra fixed the issue of unsound fixed-point multiplication by correctly constraining the limbs in the circuit."
