## Short Description of the Vulnerability

The bug occurs when the function 'execute_batch_utils.cairo' cannot process a scenario where the variable 'n_risk_factor_segments' is set to zero. This situation leads to unclear behavior that may affect the function's robustness or cause unexpected results. The recommendation is to consider explicitly forbidding this case through an assertion in the code to ensure stability and predictability.

## Short Description of the Exploit



## Proposed Mitigation

The recommended fix is to explicitly forbid the case where n_risk_factor_segments is zero via an assert.
