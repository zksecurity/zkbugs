    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug report identifies a critical issue in the RLP Circuit related to the state machine initialization, specifically a missing check that should ensure the initial state is set to \"DecodeTagStart\" and the initial transaction ID is set to 1. This oversight may allow the state machine to start decoding incorrectly, potentially leading to invalid RLP decodings. The issue has been acknowledged and a fix has been implemented.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "Add a check to ensure that the initial state of the state machine in the RLP Circuit is set to DecodeTagStart and that the initial tx_id is 1."
