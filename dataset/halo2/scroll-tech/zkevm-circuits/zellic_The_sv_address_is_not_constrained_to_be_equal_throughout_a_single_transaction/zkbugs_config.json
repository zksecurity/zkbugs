    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug states that the sv_address in the transaction circuit is not consistently constrained to be the same throughout a single transaction. This leads to a situation where an attacker could use different addresses for the caller and the ECDSA signature, potentially allowing unauthorized contract calls. The recommendation is to implement a constraint ensuring that sv_address remains equal across all rows for the same transaction.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "The recommended fix for the bug regarding 'sv_address' is to add checks to ensure that sv_address is equal throughout the rows representing the same transaction. This will prevent attackers from using different addresses for the caller and the ECDSA signature's recovered address."
