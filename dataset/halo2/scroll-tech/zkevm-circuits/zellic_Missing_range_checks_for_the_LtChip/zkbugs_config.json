    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug \"Missing range checks for the LtChip\" indicates that the LtChip is not ensuring that the difference columns fall within a specified byte range, which delegates this check to other circuits utilizing this chip. This oversight compromises the proper functionality of the LtChip, leading to potential failures in comparison operations within the relevant circuits. Recommendations include adding necessary range checks to ensure safe usage of the comparison gadgets.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "Add the necessary range checks for the diff columns in the LtChip to ensure they are within the byte range, and implement checks in the TxCircuit to verify that tx_id and cum_num_txs are within specified limits."
