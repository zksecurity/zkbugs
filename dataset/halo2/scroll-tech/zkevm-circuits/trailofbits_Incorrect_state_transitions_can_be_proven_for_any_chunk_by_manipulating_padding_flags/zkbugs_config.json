    },
    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug regarding incorrect state transitions occurs because insufficient constraints in the aggregation circuit's padding logic allow malicious provers to create invalid proofs. Specifically, a malicious actor can manipulate padding flags to prove arbitrary state transitions or produce a proof for incorrect data transitions between chunks. This vulnerability poses a high severity risk as it could facilitate exploits that affect the integrity of state transitions within the zkEVM system.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "Short-term, add constraints so that `num_valid_snarks` must be non-zero and `chunk_is_valid_cells` must not have any valid cells after padding chunks. Long-term, specify, review, and test all security-critical logic such as the aggregation padding validation thoroughly to ensure robustness against manipulation."
