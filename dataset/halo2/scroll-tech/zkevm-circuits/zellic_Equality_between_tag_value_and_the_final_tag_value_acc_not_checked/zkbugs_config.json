    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug \"Equality between tag_value and the final tag_value_acc not checked\" refers to a missing validation in the RLP circuit's state machine during the transition from the Bytes state to the DecodeTagStart state. There is no condition to ensure that the accumulated tag value (tag_value_acc) equals the final tag value (tag_value) when the tag index equals the tag length, which could result in incorrect values being stored in the RLP table. The recommendation is to implement a check to validate that tag_value and tag_value_acc are equal.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "Add a check to ensure that `tag_value` is equal to `tag_value_acc` before transitioning from the Bytes state to the DecodeTagStart state. This will verify that the accumulated tag value matches the expected value."
