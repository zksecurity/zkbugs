    },
    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug described is that the first row of each transaction in the calldata section of the Tx Circuit is underconstrained, meaning there are no checks ensuring the starting index is 0 and appropriating the accurate initial calldata gas cost. This could allow the index and gas cost values to be manipulated, leading to incorrect data processing for transactions. Appropriate constraints should be added to rectify this issue.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "The recommended fix for the bug \"The first row of each Tx in the calldata section is underconstrained in Tx Circuit\" is to add the necessary constraints for the first row to ensure that index = 0 and calldata_gas_cost_acc is set correctly based on the value of the first calldata byte. This would prevent malicious changes to the index and calldata_gas_cost for the first row of the transaction."
