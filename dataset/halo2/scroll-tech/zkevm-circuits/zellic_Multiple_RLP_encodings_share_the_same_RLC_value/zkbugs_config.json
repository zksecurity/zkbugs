    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug report indicates that multiple RLP encodings can yield the same Random Linear Combination (RLC) value when using the formula for calculating RLC, as this formula does not account for the potential addition of arbitrary leading zeroes to an RLP tag. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker can prepend zero bytes to an encoded transaction without altering the calculated RLC value. The recommendation for mitigating this issue involves adding a separate column to track the length of the RLP tag, ensuring that the combination of RLC value and tag length remains unique.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "The recommended fix for the bug \"Multiple RLP encodings share the same RLC value\" is to add an additional column, `tag_length`, which contains the number of bytes in an RLP tag, ensuring that the combination of `(bytes_rlc, tag_length)` will always correspond to unique RLP tags."
