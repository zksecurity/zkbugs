    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug regarding the \"Transition to new RLP instance in the state machine\" is that the constraints for transitioning between RLP instances are too lenient. Specifically, it allows cases like (tx_id', format') = (tx_id - 1, format + 1), which may lead to the same transaction appearing multiple times in the state machine. Proper checks need to be implemented to ensure valid transitions.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "The recommended fix for the bug regarding the underconstraint of the transition to a new RLP instance in the state machine is to implement proper checks for the transition conditions, ensuring that (tx_id', format') cannot equal (tx_id - 1, format + 1) and that tag' must be either TxType or BeginList."
