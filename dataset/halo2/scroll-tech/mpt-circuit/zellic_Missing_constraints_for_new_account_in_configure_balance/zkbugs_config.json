    },
    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug 'Missing constraints for new account in configure_balance' indicates that within the MPT circuit's configure_balance function, there is a lack of a required constraint that the sibling must equal zero when creating a new entry in the accounts trie and assigning the balance of the account. This omission may lead to soundness issues during the update of the balance for a new address. It is recommended to add a check to enforce that the sibling (nonce/codesize) is indeed equal to zero.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "Add a constraint in the configure_balance function to ensure that the sibling is equal to 0 when the segment type is AccountLeaf3 and the path type is ExtensionNew. This will prevent potential soundness issues when updating the balance of a new address."
