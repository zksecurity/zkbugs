    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug in the OneHot encoding gadget involves incorrect constraints due to a helper function that mistakenly queries the current row's binary columns instead of the previous row's values. This flaw can lead to the generation of invalid proofs in the MPT (Merkle Patricia Tree) Circuit. A fix has been acknowledged and implemented by Scroll to address this issue.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "The OneHot encoding gadget has incorrect constraints due to querying the value of the binary columns representing the one-hot encoding at the current row instead of the previous row. It is recommended to fix this by using BinaryColumn::previous to query the previous row."
