    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug \"Missing range check for address values in MPT Circuit\" relates to the lack of validation for account addresses used as MPT keys, which could lead to multiple keys being generated for the same address. This situation risks creating inconsistencies in the state trie, as the absence of range checks enables potential attackers to manipulate values. The recommendation is to implement appropriate checks to ensure address values fall within specific byte ranges.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "Add appropriate range checks for the account address and associated values in the MPT Circuit, ensuring that the address is within 20 bytes (160 bits), the address_high within 16 bytes (128 bits), and the calculated address_low (before multiplication by 2^96) within 4 bytes (32 bits)."
