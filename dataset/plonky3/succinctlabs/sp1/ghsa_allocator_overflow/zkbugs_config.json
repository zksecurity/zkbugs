    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "SP1's embedded allocator had two overflow vulnerabilities: (1) In read_vec_raw function (introduced in v4.0.1), the check 'ptr + capacity > MAX_MEMORY' did not use overflow-safe arithmetic for the addition. When capacity is large (e.g., near u32::MAX), ptr + capacity can wrap around to a small address, bypassing the check. This allows arbitrary memory writes - for example, if a program does two read_vec calls, the second could corrupt the first buffer's memory. (2) The heap size calculation (_end to EMBEDDED_RESERVED_INPUT_START) had no check ensuring _end <= EMBEDDED_RESERVED_INPUT_START, potentially causing heap size overflow and overlap with the hint area. The bump allocator (default) was not affected by either issue. Found during Zellic audit, fixed in v5.0.0.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "Would require crafting malicious input with large capacity values to trigger overflow.",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "Replace unsafe addition with overflow-safe variant: change 'if ptr + capacity > MAX_MEMORY' to 'if ptr.saturating_add(capacity) > MAX_MEMORY'. saturating_add clamps to usize::MAX on overflow instead of wrapping, ensuring the check cannot be bypassed. Implemented in v5.0.0 (commit aa9a8e40)."
