    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "In SP1's STARK verifier, the prover-provided chip_ordering is used to fetch the index of chips that have preprocessed columns. Prior to v4.0.0, validation that this chip_ordering correctly provides these indexes was missing. The recursive verifier and on-chain verifier were not affected.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "Would require crafting a malicious proof with incorrect chip_ordering.",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "Add a check that the indexed chip's name is equal to the name stored in the verifying key's chip information (implemented in v4.0.0)."
