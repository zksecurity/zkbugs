    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "In SP1's native Rust verifier (crates/prover/src/verify.rs), the verify_compressed, verify_shrink, and verify_deferred_proof functions validated verification keys by checking if their hash was in the precomputed recursion_vk_map, but did not validate that the vk_root field (merkle root of all valid verifying key hashes) in the proof's public values matched the expected precomputed vk_root. This allowed a malicious prover to submit proofs with an arbitrary/invalid vk_root that would still pass verification. The recursive verifier circuit and on-chain verifier were not affected as they correctly constrained vk_root propagation. Found during Zellic audit, fixed in v5.0.0 (commit aa9a8e40).",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "Not reproduced - no test case available. Would require crafting a malicious proof with an invalid vk_root that passes verification in compress/shrink/deferred stages.",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "Add explicit vk_root validation in the Rust verifier: check that public_values.vk_root == self.recursion_vk_root in verify_compressed, verify_shrink, and verify_deferred_proof functions. Return InvalidPublicValues error if mismatch detected. Also add is_recursion_public_values_valid and is_root_public_values_valid helper functions for comprehensive public values validation. Implemented in v5.0.0 (commit aa9a8e40)."
