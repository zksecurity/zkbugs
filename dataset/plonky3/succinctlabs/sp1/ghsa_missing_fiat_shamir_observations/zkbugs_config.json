    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "SP1's STARK verifier uses Plonky3 to check polynomial evaluation claims via a FRI-based polynomial commitment scheme. When batching multiple polynomial evaluation claims using random linear combination, the individual evaluation claims were not observed into the Fiat-Shamir challenger before sampling the coefficient. This allows incorrect polynomial evaluation claims to be verified, leading to soundness issues. This is a vulnerability in Plonky3 (SP1's core dependency) that affects SP1.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "Not reproduced - no test case available. Would require crafting incorrect polynomial evaluation claims that pass verification due to missing Fiat-Shamir observations.",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "Observe all evaluation claims into the Fiat-Shamir challenger correctly before sampling the random coefficient for batching (implemented in v4.0.0 via Plonky3 fixes)."
