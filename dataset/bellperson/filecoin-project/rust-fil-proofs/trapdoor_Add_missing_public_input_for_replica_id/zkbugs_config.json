    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug in PoREP V25 was that the \"replica_id\" was not included as a public input in the proof circuit. This omission allowed for the use of a forged \"replica_id\" in the SDR calculation process, meaning an attacker could pre-compute the SDR values using a fake \"replica_id\" and bypass the intended security mechanism. Consequently, this flaw could lead to the reuse of one SDR replica calculation across multiple sectors, fundamentally undermining the integrity of the system.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "The recommended fix for the vulnerability is to include the replica_id as a public input in the PoREP circuit to ensure that the SDR calculation is legitimately tied to a specified replica_id, not just any replica_id. This change would prevent the exploitation where one fixed replica_id could be used for calculations across different sectors."
