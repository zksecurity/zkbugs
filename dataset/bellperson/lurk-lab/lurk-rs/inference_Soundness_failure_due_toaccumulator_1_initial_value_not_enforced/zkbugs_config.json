    },
    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug \"Soundness failure due to accumulator 1 initial value not enforced\" occurs because in the function multi_case_aux, the initial accumulator variable 'acc' is set to 1 but this value is not enforced. As a result, changing this value to 0 could manipulate the variable '_selected' to always be true, affecting the soundness of the program. This issue was corrected in a code update that involved passing a global store as input and utilizing a previously allocated 'true_num' variable.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "The recommended fix for the bug 'Soundness failure due to accumulator 1 initial value not enforced' is addressed by passing the global store as input and using the previously allocated true_num variable. This was implemented in commit 4a61333."
