    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug \"Multicase number of defaults not enforced\" refers to an issue in the 'apply_continuation()' function in Lurk's circuit logic, where it incorrectly sized the default argument for the 'multi_case' function. This misalignment resulted in some constraints not being properly enforced. The problem was rectified by supplying the correct number of arguments and adding an assertion to detect incorrect usage in the future.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "The recommended fix for the bug 'Multicase number of defaults not enforced' is providing the correct number of arguments to the function and adding an assertion to detect incorrect usage in the future. This was implemented in commit edcda97."
