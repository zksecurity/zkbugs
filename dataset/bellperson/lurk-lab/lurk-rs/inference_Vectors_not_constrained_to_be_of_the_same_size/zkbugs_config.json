    "Short Description of the Vulnerability": "The bug titled \"Vectors not constrained to be of the same size\" involves vectors in Lurk's circuit operations not being enforced to match in size, leading to potential runtime crashes or uncaught bugs. Measures including adding assertions for size consistency have been implemented to address these issues and prevent potential soundness or runtime problems.",
    "Short Description of the Exploit": "",
    "Proposed Mitigation": "To fix the bug 'Vectors not constrained to be of the same size,' the recommended fix involves adding assertions in various functions to ensure vectors are the same size, preventing runtime crashes and uncaught bugs. This was implemented and validated through adjusted tests as per commit d2c7c69."
